## Forecasting the Future: A Modern Economics Challenge

My forecast model is made up of 3 separate files:
1. "theory-driven model selection.py" prepares the data and selects the best configurations for each forecast;
2. "model.py" performs the baseline projection and adjusts it with driver-based logic;
3. "app.py" handles the formatting and presentation of forecast data when deployed as an interactive web app.
